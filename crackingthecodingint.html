                <p>At most of the top tech companies (and many other companies), algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process</p>
                <p>If you haven't heard back from a company within 3 - 5 business days after your interview, check in (politely) with your recruiter.</p>

                <p>"Why do you want to work for Microsoft?": "I've been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I've been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and its APls are excellent:' </p>

                <p>Structure
                    A typical structure that works well for many people is essentially chronological, with the opening sentence describing their current job and the conclusion discussing their relevant and interesting hobbies outside ofwork (ifany).
                    1. Current Role [Headline Only): "I'm a software engineer at Microworks, where I've been leading the Android team for the last five years:'
                    2. College: My background is in computer science. I did my undergrad at Berkeley and spent a few summers working at startups, including one where I attempted to launch my own business.
                    3. PostCollege&Onwards:Aftercollege,IwantedtogetsomeexposuretolargercorporationssoIjoined Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to really drive the launch of a key part of AWS.That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment.
                    4. Current Role [Details]: One of myoid managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup, which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaled pretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage a team of three, but my role is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.
                    5. Outside of Work: Outside of work, I've been participating in some hackathons-mostly doing iOS development there as a way to learn it more deeply. I'm also active as a moderator on online forums around Android development.
                    6. Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.

                <h2>VI - big O</h2>
                <p>
                    Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. Not understanding it thoroughly can really hurt you in developing an algorithm. Not only might you be judged harshly for not really understanding big 0, but you will also struggle to judge when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.
                    <b>Master this concept.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    ~ Time Complexity
                    This is what the concept of asymptotic runtime, or big 0 time, means. We could describe the data transfer "algorithm" runtime as:
                    •
                    Electronic Transfer: 0(5), where 5 is the size of the file. This means that the time to transfer the file increases linearly with the size of the file. (Yes, this is a bit of a simplification, but that's okay for these purposes.)
                    Airplane Transfer: 0 (1) with respect to the size of the file. As the size of the file increases, it won't take any longer to get the file to your friend.The time is constant.
                </p>
                <p>For this book, we will use big 0 in the way that industry tends to use it: By always trying to offer the tightest description of the runtime.</p>

                <h2>VII - technical questions</h2>
                <p>Technical questions form the basis for how many of the top tech companies interview. Many candidates are intimidated by the difficulty of these questions, but there are logical ways to approach them.

                <p>You're usually only expected to know the basics. Here's a list of the absolute, must-have knowledge:</p>
