    		<h3>Chapter 3 - The technical skills you need to have</h3>
    		<p>Learn One Programming Language</p>
        <p>After or during: learn how to properly structure your code: Code Complete book</p>
        <p>Object Oriented design: have a good understanding of what a class is, what the different types of inheritance are, and when to use them, understand terms like: polymorphism and encapsulation</p>
        <p>Algorithms and Data structures: several algos that are commonly used for sorting lists of things programmatically. Data structures: arrays or vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hashes, sets</p>
        <p><b>JOIN <a href="https://www.topcoder.com">TOPCODER</a></b></p>
        <p>Read: Cracking the Coding interview, by Gayle Laakmann McDowell</p>
        <p>A development platform and related technologies: Mac/Windows/Linux/Web</p>
        <p>Framework of Stack: framework is simply a set of libraries that are used to develop code on a particular platform or on multiple platforms; A <i>Stack</i> is a set of technologies, usually including a framework, that are commonly used together to create a full application (MEAN stack, MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)</p>
        <p>Baisc Database Knowledge: relational databases and document databases; how they work, how to perform basic queries to get data, how to insert, update and delete data, how to join datasets together, and how to retrieve and store data programmatically from your code</p>
        <p>Source Control: how to check in code, check out code, and hopefully merge changes from multiple sources; </p>
        <p>Build and Deployment: after you check code into source control system, have some way to make sure that code actually works after you check it in; Build system is going to compile all the code and make sure there are no compliation errors; may run unit tests or user test, run code quality checks, and provide some reporting; A Deployment system will be responsible for deplyoing the code either to a production machine or perhaps to some kind of a test environment: You dont have to be an expert, but its pretty important that you understand at least the basics of how these systems work</p>
        <p>Testing: terms like; whitebox testing, blackbox testing, unit testing (not really testing), boundary conditions, test automation, acceptance testing</p>
        <p>Debugging: if you apply test-drive dev, youll spend less time in the debugging phase; learn to debug yourself or others code; </p>
        <p>Methodologies: 'Scrum' search that methodology; be at least familiar with some of the basic ideas behind the most common software dev methodologies; <i>Waterfall dev</i> and <i>Agile dev</i></p>

        <h3>Chapter 4 - How to develop technical skills</h3>
        <p>Learning how to learn quickly</p>
        <p>The basic process: first get a good idea of what you are learning and what the scope of it is</p>
        <p>get a big picture, and narrow down to a small enough scope, so you can tackle it and wrap your head around it</p>
        <p>then you need a goal and what metric you will use to know that youve learned it</p>
        <p>gather some resources for learning</p>
        <p>gather multiple resources, books, blogs, podcasts, magazines, video courses, tuts, expert opinions</p>
        <p>create a plan for learning based on those resources</p>
        <p>use the table of contents to help figure out what order you should try to learn things</p>
        <p><b>then teach it to someone else</b></p>
        <p>Learn by Doing: </p>
        <p><i>git side note:</i>merging a file into the wrong branch, or checking out the wrong version of the source code, used a version history to figure out where a bug got introduced</p>
        <p>How to learn by doing: first start by figuring out what it is going to help you do; </p>
        <p>An example of learning by doing: relational databases and how to use them; instead of just learning, think of what you want to do with, say create a movie database that I own; insert to it, delete, update etc then search and learn how to achieve that!</p>
        <p>How I Teach technical skills</p>
        <p>3 things I try to teach someone when I am teaching a technical skill: the big picture, what can you do with the technology; how to get started; the 20% you need to know to be the most effective</p>
        <p>The Big Picture: history of the language and what it is used for; all the constructs of the language and language features, especially unique ones; various libraries that are standard part of the language; </p>
        <p>How to get started: download what ever is needed, get it installed, create their first project, and compile their code</p>
        <p>You need to know 20% to be the most effective: in the example of database: learn how to write select statements, join tables and other commong operations</p>
        <p>Read what experts are writing: spend 30 minutes each day reading various blogs related to subjects I was learning about; </p>
        <p>Practice, practice, practice: </p>

        <h3>Chapter 5 - what programming language should I learn</h3>
        <p>The actual language doesnt matter at all: </p>
        <p>Considerations for picking a language: doesnt matter</p>
        <p>Job Prospects and future: C#, java, python, ruby, javascript, C++, PHP</p>
        <p>Technology that you are interested in: </p>
        <p>Difficulty level: dont start with C++</p>
        <p>Resources available to you: </p>
        <p>Adaptability: pick one commonly used</p>
        <p>Some final thoughts on picking a language: you dont need to know all the intricacies of the language; todays programming utilizes libraries and frameworks, more than language features; <b>absolute mastery isnt as valuable a skill as it was</b></p>

        <h3>Chapter 6 - Learning your first programming language</h3>
        <p>Start by looking at a working application</p>
        <p>Look for an open source app on github</p>
        <p>Find a few good resources or books and scan through them</p>
        <p>Learn how to create hello world</p>
        <p>create the most basic program</p>
        <p>learn basic constructs and test them out with real problems:</p>
        <p>here is a list of basic constructs most programming languages should contain</p>
        <ol>
          <li>ability to write output to the screen</li>
          <li>basic math capability</li>
          <li>storage of information as a variable</li>
          <li>organization of code into functions, methods, or modules</li>
          <li>invoke a function or method</li>
          <li>performance of boolean logic evaluations</li>
          <li>branch conditional statements(if/else)</li>
          <li>looping statements</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>that is the cord of programming in any language</b></p>
        <p>know the difference between language features and libraries</p>
        <p><b>programming today is more about knowing how to use libraries and frameworks than being an absolute expert in the language</b></p>
        <p>review existing code and work through understanding each line: here is where people get stuck because they learnt how a function works, but don't know how to use it in the real world, so it is good to look at existing code, line by line, and making sure you understand exactly what each line and statement in the code is doing</p>        
        <p><b>build something, lots of somethings</b></p>
        <p>here is a list of some simple project ideas to get you started:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>create a program that solves a mathematical problem by getting inputs from the user</li>
          <li>create a choose your own adventure type of program where the input from the user determines what happens next</li>
          <li>create a very simple text-based adventure game where the user can issue commands to pick up objects, move through rooms, etc</li>
          <li>create a program that is able to read input from a text file and write output to a different text file</li>
          <li>create a chatbot that talks to the user and pretends to be human or gives humorous responses</li>
        </ol>
        <p>apply the programming language to a specific technology or platform</p>
        <p><b>now you will be developing specific specialized skills with the programming language you are learning that will be useful for getting a job: start creating a few small applications using it</b></p>
        <p>solve difficult algorithm problems with the language to master it</p>
        <p><b>USE SITES LIKE TOPCODER</b> to do competitions, new programming challenges every week <i>at first he was horrible, couldn't solve the easiest problems, then by watching other people solve the problems and seeing their code, he got better and better</i></p>
        <p><b>good sources for praticing algorithmic problems</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>cracking the coding interview, book</li>
          <li>programming pearls, book</li>
          <li>project euler, site</li>
          <li>codility, site</li>
          <li>interview cake, site</li>
          <li>topcoder, site</li>
        </ol>
        <p>the problems will be difficult, but you will see that there are only a handful of types of problems, and able to identify how to solve them</p>
