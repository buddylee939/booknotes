    		<h3>Chapter 3 - The technical skills you need to have</h3>
    		<p>Learn One Programming Language</p>
        <p>After or during: learn how to properly structure your code: Code Complete book</p>
        <p>Object Oriented design: have a good understanding of what a class is, what the different types of inheritance are, and when to use them, understand terms like: polymorphism and encapsulation</p>
        <p>Algorithms and Data structures: several algos that are commonly used for sorting lists of things programmatically. Data structures: arrays or vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hashes, sets</p>
        <p><b>JOIN <a href="https://www.topcoder.com">TOPCODER</a></b></p>
        <p>Read: Cracking the Coding interview, by Gayle Laakmann McDowell</p>
        <p>A development platform and related technologies: Mac/Windows/Linux/Web</p>
        <p>Framework of Stack: framework is simply a set of libraries that are used to develop code on a particular platform or on multiple platforms; A <i>Stack</i> is a set of technologies, usually including a framework, that are commonly used together to create a full application (MEAN stack, MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)</p>
        <p>Baisc Database Knowledge: relational databases and document databases; how they work, how to perform basic queries to get data, how to insert, update and delete data, how to join datasets together, and how to retrieve and store data programmatically from your code</p>
        <p>Source Control: how to check in code, check out code, and hopefully merge changes from multiple sources; </p>
        <p>Build and Deployment: after you check code into source control system, have some way to make sure that code actually works after you check it in; Build system is going to compile all the code and make sure there are no compliation errors; may run unit tests or user test, run code quality checks, and provide some reporting; A Deployment system will be responsible for deplyoing the code either to a production machine or perhaps to some kind of a test environment: You dont have to be an expert, but its pretty important that you understand at least the basics of how these systems work</p>
        <p>Testing: terms like; whitebox testing, blackbox testing, unit testing (not really testing), boundary conditions, test automation, acceptance testing</p>
        <p>Debugging: if you apply test-drive dev, youll spend less time in the debugging phase; learn to debug yourself or others code; </p>
        <p>Methodologies: 'Scrum' search that methodology; be at least familiar with some of the basic ideas behind the most common software dev methodologies; <i>Waterfall dev</i> and <i>Agile dev</i></p>

        <h3>Chapter 4 - How to develop technical skills</h3>
        <p>Learning how to learn quickly</p>
        <p>The basic process: first get a good idea of what you are learning and what the scope of it is</p>
        <p>get a big picture, and narrow down to a small enough scope, so you can tackle it and wrap your head around it</p>
        <p>then you need a goal and what metric you will use to know that youve learned it</p>
        <p>gather some resources for learning</p>
        <p>gather multiple resources, books, blogs, podcasts, magazines, video courses, tuts, expert opinions</p>
        <p>create a plan for learning based on those resources</p>
        <p>use the table of contents to help figure out what order you should try to learn things</p>
        <p><b>then teach it to someone else</b></p>
        <p>Learn by Doing: </p>
        <p><i>git side note:</i>merging a file into the wrong branch, or checking out the wrong version of the source code, used a version history to figure out where a bug got introduced</p>
        <p>How to learn by doing: first start by figuring out what it is going to help you do; </p>
        <p>An example of learning by doing: relational databases and how to use them; instead of just learning, think of what you want to do with, say create a movie database that I own; insert to it, delete, update etc then search and learn how to achieve that!</p>
        <p>How I Teach technical skills</p>
        <p>3 things I try to teach someone when I am teaching a technical skill: the big picture, what can you do with the technology; how to get started; the 20% you need to know to be the most effective</p>
        <p>The Big Picture: history of the language and what it is used for; all the constructs of the language and language features, especially unique ones; various libraries that are standard part of the language; </p>
        <p>How to get started: download what ever is needed, get it installed, create their first project, and compile their code</p>
        <p>You need to know 20% to be the most effective: in the example of database: learn how to write select statements, join tables and other commong operations</p>
        <p>Read what experts are writing: spend 30 minutes each day reading various blogs related to subjects I was learning about; </p>
        <p>Practice, practice, practice: </p>

        <h3>Chapter 5 - what programming language should I learn</h3>
        <p>The actual language doesnt matter at all: </p>
        <p>Considerations for picking a language: doesnt matter</p>
        <p>Job Prospects and future: C#, java, python, ruby, javascript, C++, PHP</p>
        <p>Technology that you are interested in: </p>
        <p>Difficulty level: dont start with C++</p>
        <p>Resources available to you: </p>
        <p>Adaptability: pick one commonly used</p>
        <p>Some final thoughts on picking a language: you dont need to know all the intricacies of the language; todays programming utilizes libraries and frameworks, more than language features; <b>absolute mastery isnt as valuable a skill as it was</b></p>

        <h3>Chapter 6 - Learning your first programming language</h3>
        <p>Start by looking at a working application</p>
        <p>Look for an open source app on github</p>
        <p>Find a few good resources or books and scan through them</p>
        <p>Learn how to create hello world</p>
        <p>create the most basic program</p>
        <p>learn basic constructs and test them out with real problems:</p>
        <p>here is a list of basic constructs most programming languages should contain</p>
        <ol>
          <li>ability to write output to the screen</li>
          <li>basic math capability</li>
          <li>storage of information as a variable</li>
          <li>organization of code into functions, methods, or modules</li>
          <li>invoke a function or method</li>
          <li>performance of boolean logic evaluations</li>
          <li>branch conditional statements(if/else)</li>
          <li>looping statements</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>that is the cord of programming in any language</b></p>
        <p>know the difference between language features and libraries</p>
        <p><b>programming today is more about knowing how to use libraries and frameworks than being an absolute expert in the language</b></p>
        <p>review existing code and work through understanding each line: here is where people get stuck because they learnt how a function works, but don't know how to use it in the real world, so it is good to look at existing code, line by line, and making sure you understand exactly what each line and statement in the code is doing</p>        
        <p><b>build something, lots of somethings</b></p>
        <p>here is a list of some simple project ideas to get you started:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>create a program that solves a mathematical problem by getting inputs from the user</li>
          <li>create a choose your own adventure type of program where the input from the user determines what happens next</li>
          <li>create a very simple text-based adventure game where the user can issue commands to pick up objects, move through rooms, etc</li>
          <li>create a program that is able to read input from a text file and write output to a different text file</li>
          <li>create a chatbot that talks to the user and pretends to be human or gives humorous responses</li>
        </ol>
        <p>apply the programming language to a specific technology or platform</p>
        <p><b>now you will be developing specific specialized skills with the programming language you are learning that will be useful for getting a job: start creating a few small applications using it</b></p>
        <p>solve difficult algorithm problems with the language to master it</p>
        <p><b>USE SITES LIKE TOPCODER</b> to do competitions, new programming challenges every week <i>at first he was horrible, couldn't solve the easiest problems, then by watching other people solve the problems and seeing their code, he got better and better</i></p>
        <p><b>good sources for praticing algorithmic problems</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>cracking the coding interview, book</li>
          <li>programming pearls, book</li>
          <li>project euler, site</li>
          <li>codility, site</li>
          <li>interview cake, site</li>
          <li>topcoder, site</li>
        </ol>
        <p>the problems will be difficult, but you will see that there are only a handful of types of problems, and able to identify how to solve them</p>

          <p>the biggest risk for companies hiring a developer</p>
          <p>interviewers are going to test you as if they dont want you to make it, but secretly they want you to succeed, they want you to be that person they hire</p>
          <p>dont let them rattle your cage: keep your cool, be cool</p>
          <p>many do 'whiteboard coding interviews' where they ask you to code something to see if you know what your doing</p>
          <p>overcoming that risk: </p>
          <p>have an online presence: when they google your name, professional blog where you have a bunck of articles about the specific software dev technologies you are specializing in, <b>and its up to date</b></p>
          <p><b>every soft dev should have a blog</b> even if you have nothing to say, just do it</p>
          <p>have a portfolio: create some small projects, while learning to code, and your ability by writing an entire application from start to finish</p>
          <p><b>if I was starting out, I would make my GITHUB profile as impressive as possible</b></p>
          <p><b>have a portfolio of at least 3-4 apps or projects youve built</b></p>
          <p>they dont have to be big, but they shouldnt be completeley trivial either</p>
          <p>include unit test or automated tests</p>
          <p>you can bring your laptop with one of these projects already loaded up so that you can show the interviewer the code you wrote and go through why you designed things the way you did</p>
          <p>create your onw company: build an app, sell somewhere, make a little website, and call yourself the developer for that company </p>
          <p>prepare for interviews: do your homework, spend plenty time preparing by both studying questions and doing mock interview with friends, relatives</p>
          <p>get a camera and record yourself doing an interview</p>
          <p><b><i>BUSINESS IDEA: WEBSITE WHERE THEY DO MOCK INTERVIEWS TO PRACTICE</i></b></p>
          <p>make sure to be ableto pass any kind of coding interview, like in 'cracking the coding interview'</p>
          <p>build your network: meetups or developer organizations</p>

                <h2>Chapter 12 - How to find a job</h2>
                <p>the cookie cutter approach: if you are going to take the standard approach, at least be doing it correctly, heres how...</p>
                <p>its a numbers game: use hte 'job application tracker' from his site to keep track ofjobs applied for, responses received, telephone screens, interviews, offers</p>
                <p>have a good resume: hire a professional resume writer, who specializes in technology industry resumes, might cost $500</p>
                <p>crete a quota of jobs to apply for: it should be at least 5 jobs a day, or 10</p>
                <p>it might take 1 hour per job application: you are going to speciically apply for each job by writing a custom cover letter and altering your resume to better match each job.</p>
                <p>how to apply for jobs: make your resume and cover letter match the job description and any other information you can gather about the company as much as possible; match as closely without seeming too obvious</p>
                <p>take a careful look at job descriptions, and feel what the most importan skills and characteristics are being looked for</p>                
                <p>research the company and write up a cover letter that sells the hiring manager on why you are specifically the best applicant; mention something that only someone who actually did some research on the company would know</p>
                <p>Measure results: keep track of howmany jobs you appled for, what days, what response if any, what version of your resume, and anything else relevant</p>
                <p>alter your plan: get feedback, and tweak along the way</p>
                <p>work directly with a recruiter: </p>
                <p>think outside the box: 80% of jobs are not advertised,</p>
                <p>build a network: to get access to jobs that arent advertised is to know someone who know someone.</p>
                <p>meet lots of people and give them lots of value; find out how you can help the more than the other way around</p>
                <p><b>as many meetups and software development groups as possible</b></p>
                <p>specifically target companies: when looking for a remote job, he did the following</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>he found one particular company that had completely remote devs</li>
                    <li>he learnt about the company</li>
                    <li>he learnt who worked for the company</li>
                    <li>he started following the blogs of devs who worked for the company</li>
                    <li>he started commenting on their blogs and building relationships with the devs</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Build something userful: to them to get theri attention</p>
                <p>Start at the top: </p>
                <p>utilize inbound marketing: creating content or some other kind of value that gets people coming to you instead of you to them; build a blog, video tutorials, write books, write articles, appear on podcasts</p>

                <h2>Chapter 13 - Creating a resume</h2>
                <p>First step: dont create a resume: hire a professional resume writer, but be particular who you choose.</p>
                <p>Picking a resume writer: get referrals; someone who specializes in either software developer resumes or technology resumes; ask for samples of their work; expect to pay from $300 to $500</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.itresumeservice.com/">HE SUGGETS THIS ONE</a></p>
                <p>Working with a resume writer: have the following information prepared</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the exact ates of all of your previous relevant work</li>
                    <li>titles and job descriptions of each job</li>
                    <li>as many major accomplishments you can think of for each job</li>
                    <li>all your education history</li>
                    <li>any certifications you have or other honors</li>
                    <li>a list of what you consider your most important or relevant skills</li>
                    <li>a few sample job descriptions of the job or jobs you'd like to get hired for</li>
                    <li>anything else you think would be relevant</li>
                </ol>
                <p>you'll probably want to ask the resume writer you hire to produce a few different versions of you resume geared towards different positions or presented in a different way; youll also want a sample cover letter that you will greatly alter when you apply for specific jobs;</p>
                <p>What makes a good resume: a resume needs to communicate, quickly and effectively, what you are all about and what value you can bring to a prospective employer; what they care about is what value you can provide and how much of a hot commodity you are, not that your objective is to 'utilize your C# skills while working on an effective team in the medical field'</p>
                <p>it should be short and to the point, highligh the most important achievements; the more you can say with less, the bigger impact youll have</p>
                <p>writing our own resume: start with linkedin; make sure your linkedin dates and resume dates match; </p>
                <p>Make it about the value you provide: </p>
                <p>What you did, how you did it, and the results you got: something along the line of 'Designed and programmed a unique and innovative cat-morphing algorithm using jave and the spring framework, which improved the performance and adoption of an application for reateing cat-shaped logos by over 500%'</p>
                <p>Proofread: </p>
                <p>Have multiple versions: </p>

                <h2>Chapter 14 - The interview process</h2>
                <p>Kinds of interviews: </p>
                <p>Phone screen: usually technical in nature, but can have non-technical questions; give as much detail as possible</p>
                <p>Online techncal interview: skype call; very difficult to bullshit; solving algorithm-type problems, understanding data structures</p>
                <p>Standard technical interview: most common type; one-hour, in person, technical interviews; <b>google a list of common inteview questions related to the primary technology or programming language, and know the answers</b></p>
                <p>Culture fit interview: to see if you will fit in withe the team and personality-wise; avoid any anti-social behavior, be yourself</p>
                <p>Panel interview: multiple people asking multiple questions</p>
                <p>Coding interview: youll be asked to solve some algorithm problem by writing some code; <b>study specifically for them, download the interview prep crash course from his site; then practice, practice, practice</b></p>
                <p>All day or half day interview: expect to go from interviewer to interviewer during the day, to have a lunch interview, and then some kind of interview with management or a panel at the end; </p>
                <p>What you need to know: </p>
                <p>How to solve coding problems: use the book 'cracking the coding interview' book; <b>he has a course on Pluralsight, preparing for a job interview, that has algo-type problems</b>; </p>
                <p><b><i>he says to google 'FizzBuzz' to now get blindsighted by it</i></b></p>
                <p>Common technical questions about your technology/expertise: know the answer to every single question in the top three results from Google on your technology choice and interview questions; <b> if it is an OOP language, know what encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, interfaces, and abstract base classes are</b>; </p>
                <p>Pesonality and psychological questions: like</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>what is your greatest strength</li>
                    <li>what is your worst weakness?</li>
                    <li>where do you see yourself in five years</li>
                    <li>what was a challenge or conflict you got into at work and how did you handle it</li>
                    <li>why do you want to work here/ want this job</li>
                    <li>can you tell me a little about yourself</li>
                    <li>why are you leaving your current job</li>
                </ol>
                <p>in the 'what is your weakness' answer like ' well, i tend to be a perfectionist, which is greate because my extreme attention to detail means that I don't make careless mistakes and I produce high quality work, but I can also sometimes become a little to obsessed with making things perfect' </p>
                <p>Interview tips: you shouldn't be relying on the interview as the time to impress the interviewer; </p>
                <p>Dress right: dress 2 levels above the standard office dress code; suggests to do it with a nice suit; <b>check on his website</b></p>
                <p>Be on time: on time is 10 minutes early; </p>
                <p>Don't lie: if you don't know the answer just state it, but are interested in learning the answer; </p>
                <p>Don't defend yourself: its easy to slip to defensive mode, don't</p>
                <p>Elaborate: get as musch stage time as possible; </p>
                <p>Be confident ( not act ): 'we don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training' </p>
                <p>Demonstrate this one, all important message: 'I am self-motivated, I figure out what needs to be done and I do it'; </p>
                <p>Practice, practice, practice: practice mock interviews in the mirror, with your pets, record on video and watch back, practice coding problems on whiteboards</p>

                <p>print out from his site, the negotiation checklist</p>
                <p>know your salary range: search <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">https://www.glassdoor.com/</a>; search on google; </p>
                <p>getting the offer: it is always a good idea to follow up, sending an email asking about when to expect a decision; </p>
                <p>negotiating: better to negotiate at the beginning than trying to get raises as you work there</p>
                <p>positioning: the person who can most afford to walk away from a deal always has the best position; be extremely well prepared for an interview; know the job market, the company you are negotiating with, and the salary info; </p>
                <p>whoever names a number first, loses: under no circumstances should you reveal your current salary and you should never name the salary you are looking for until youve been given an offer first. if asked current salary say 'it is confidential info from your current employer'; if asked what you are looking for 'I will entertain any resonable offer, and or like to hear about the entire compensation package rather than just name an arbitrary number'</p>
                <p>don't be afraid to counter offer: have a clear goal in mind for what you would like to get, and the minimum you are willing to accept; </p>
                <p>everything is negotiable: not only salary, but vacation days, medical benefits, or other perks; even working hours;</p>
                <p>don't succumb to time pressure: </p>
                <p>multiple offers: don't go to one prospective employer and say ' well, so and so company offered me X amoun and Y vacation, so youd need to at least offer me Z'; having offeres gives you the ability to walk away, not to play offers against each other.</p>

                <p>when you leave a job: if the job you are in is not providing new challenges for you and you don't see any opportunity to grow, good indicator to move one; or the environment is toxic; </p>
                <p>how to leave a job: make the break as clean and non-personal as possible; 'never complain and never explain'</p>
                <p>don't worry about 'the team': you are not abandoning the team, you are making a career and business decision; </p>
                <p>give 2 weeks notice: even if they ask for you to stay longe </p>
                <p>don't threaten to leave a job: if youre going to leave, just leave; </p>
                <p>don't give advance notice: a friend of his, to be nice, told his employer he wanted to go freelance in 2 months, the employer said 'nah thats ok, leave now'</p>
                <p>the world is incredibly small: </p>
                <p>train your replacement: a good leader knows that they become immensely more valuable by building teams, companies, processes, and infrastructure that allow things to run smoothly without them, and not the 'this place will fall apart if I'm not here'; </p>
